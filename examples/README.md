# Predefined Badge Examples

The predefined badging system supports giving friendly names and variables
to badges much like shields.io or badgen.net do, but is implemented entirely
as a set of configuration files which invokes the underlying dynamic badge
system.

It is based on YAML files, and simply loads all files in a target directory
to allow additively building up badge lists.
